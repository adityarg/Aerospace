1. "T", "w" and "si" will be given as input.
2. First order system converges for positive values of "T" (LHP poles).
3. Second order system converges when both "w" and "si" have same sign (LHP poles).
4. All of the parameters converges to zero.
5. Taken input (x) as zero.
6. State space equation for 1st order system: d(y)/dt = -y/T
7. State space equation for 2nd order system: a) d(y)/dt = y_dot
			      		      b) d(y_dot)/dt = -2*si*w*y_dot - w*w*y
